# Projects
Project 1: Data filtering
 * The goal: write a "filter" function that will take the default parameters "low"=30, "high"=50 and a simple parameter - a list of objects of the Users class. The function should go through all the users and check the age with the low and high parameters. The function should return only those users whose age is above the "low" parameter and below the "high" parameter. Print out their email address and age. I have a file "users.txt" and i should do the following:
 * Step 1: create a class "Users"
 * Step 2: read the file users.txt line by line
 * Step 3: write a function "filter"
